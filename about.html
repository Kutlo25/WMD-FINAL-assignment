<p></p>Hello and welcome! I’m Natasha, the founder of Savoury Sensations, a 25 year old wife and mom to 3 kids, currently residing in Gaborone.

Cooking has been a lifelong love, inspired by countless hours in the kitchen with my mother, where I learned the fundamentals of home-cooked comfort food. What started as a simple way to share family recipes has grown into Savoury Sensations, a trusted source for approachable, delicious dishes enjoyed by millions.

As a self-taught cook, I’ve spent over a decade perfecting the art of making home cooked foods flavorful and accessible. Whether it’s simplifying classic dishes or creating new favorites, my goal is to feed the nation at large with home cooked foods made with love.</p>

<p>Hope to interact with you again!</p>
